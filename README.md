# Guessing-Game-Java
Java Application Implementing JFrame

This is my First try on a Java application implementing JFrame.

This is a basic application which generates a random whole number between 1-100 and gives the user 7 tries to guess the number correctly.
With each try it tell the user whether the number entered by the user is higher or lower than the number generated by the computer.
